## Description

SpeakSpace – GD and Interview Skill Builder

	Project Overview
	Objective
To prepare students for real-world placement processes using an AI-powered simulator that focuses on learning, practice, and mock interview simulations.

	Problem Statement
Students often struggle with placement interviews due to lack of proper preparation, unclear learning paths, and no real-time feedback. Traditional methods don’t offer personalized insights or practical simulations.

	Our Solution
An AI-based platform that provides a guided learning phase followed by an intelligent interview simulation. It gives personalized feedback, tracks progress, and enables practice with real-time AI agents.





	What We Have Built Till Now


1. Aptitude Learning + Practice
- Added structured learning materials for all aptitude topics.
- Integrated practice tests based on those topics.
- If the student gets answers wrong, correct solutions are   provided with explanations.
- Progress tracking is implemented to show improvement.

2. Group Discussion (GD) Learning
- Added GD learning modules covering:
  - Communication skills
  - How to start and contribute
  - What to avoid in a GD
  - Body language tips
- Designed a clean, unique dashboard to show combined progress from all sections.





	What We Will Add Next
1. Mock Interview Simulation
- Users can choose job role and experience level (fresher/intermediate).
- AI asks real-time HR and technical questions tailored to their choice.
- User answers via voice input, and AI analyzes speech: tone, confidence, clarity.
- At the end:
  - Score is generated
  - Feedback is given
  - Improvement suggestions are displayed

2. Adaptive Redirection System
- If a user fails the aptitude test in the simulation phase:
  - They’ll be automatically redirected to the specific learning module where they lack.

3. GD Practice with AI Agents
- Users can speak in real-time in a mock GD with AI agents.
- Speech is analyzed for confidence, relevance, clarity.
- Feedback and scoring are provided.

	Conclusion, Tech Stack, and Future Scope
Conclusion
Our AI Simulator bridges the gap between theory and practice by providing structured learning, intelligent analysis, and real-time simulations. It boosts confidence and makes students industry-ready.

Tech Stack Used
- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Supabase
- AI Integration:  Gemini AI
- Storage & DB:  Supabase

Future Scope
- Add company-specific interview simulators
- Include video-based GD sessions with peer groups
- Develop mobile app version for quick practice
- Enable CV/Resume analysis and feedback
